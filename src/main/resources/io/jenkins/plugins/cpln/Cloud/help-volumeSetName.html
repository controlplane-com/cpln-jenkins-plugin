        Optionally specify a Control Plane Volume Set to attach to the agent container.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> The volume must be of type <code>shared</code>. 
        Volumes of type <code>ext4</code> or <code>xfs</code> are NOT supported because they 
        cannot be mounted by multiple agents simultaneously and are not compatible with standard workloads.
    </p>
    <p>
        Volume Sets allow you to persist data between builds or share data across agents.
    </p>
    <p>
        If specified, you must also provide a <strong>Volume Set Path</strong> where the 
        volume will be mounted inside the container.
